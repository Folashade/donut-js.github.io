          <h1>Come Speak!</h1>

          <p>We're looking for speakers for our meetup!</p>

          <h2>How do I submit a talk?</h2>
          <p>You can either comment on <a href="https://github.com/donut-js/donut-js.github.io/issues/8">this issue</a> or send us an <a href="mailto:hello@donutjs.club">email</a>.</p>

          <h2>When/where is it</h2>
          <p>April 26th, at 6:30 at Cup and Bar! But if we get too many proposals and we really love your talk, we'd be happy to schedule you for a later month!</p>

          <h2>What should I talk about?</h2>
          <p>We don’t have a strict formula, but this is the balance we try to strike every month:</p>

          <h3>2x Creative Talks:</h3>
          <p>Creative applications of programming. Such as: generating lego murals out of static images, and building an in-browser RPG, generative art, etc.</p>

          <h3>1x Passion Talk:</h3>
          <p>Something you’re excited about outside of work. This can literally be anything! Kittens, mental health, how much you love burritos.</p>

          <h3>1x Technical Talk:</h3>
          <p>A deep dive on a technical topic!</p>

          <h2>Do I need to be an expert to talk?</h2>
          <p>Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to participate. We especially encourage people of underrepresented groups to apply!</p>

          <h2>How long should my talk be?</h2>
          <p>Ten minutes. There won't be any formal Q&amp;A.</p>

          <h2>What should be in my talk submission?</h2>
          <p>Just a few sentences describing what you want to talk about would be great.</p>
