      <h1>Sponsoring DonutJS!</h1>
      <p>Each month DonutJS is sponsored by 2-3 generous companies! We use these funds to cover food, venue costs, and equipment. All leftover proceeds from ticket sales and outside funds are donated to a non-profit in the community. Sponsorship starts at $500 for one month, with discounts for companies that would like to sponsor for multiple months.</p>

      <h2>Sponsorship includes:</h2>
      <ul><li>2 minutes to speak to the audience about your product, hiring, etc.</li>
      <li>A space at the event to give out swag</li>
      <li>Your logo on our website and in our emails to attendees</li>

      <p>If you'd like to be a sponsor, please contact us at <a href='mailto:hello@donutjs.club'>hello@donutjs.club</a></p>
